# Introduction
Welcome to the Chess Engine Documentation! This knowledge base provides comprehensive information about our PL/SQL-based chess engine implementation.

# Architecture Overview
The chess engine is built using PL/SQL and consists of several key components:
- Move Generation
- Position Evaluation
- Game State Management
- Interface Layer

## Component Interactions
Each component is designed to work independently while maintaining clear interfaces with other parts of the system.

# Move Generation
The move generation system is responsible for:
1. Calculating legal moves
2. Validating move legality
3. Special move handling (castling, en passant, etc.)

## Algorithm Details
Move generation uses a bitboard-based approach for efficient move calculation.

# Position Evaluation
The evaluation system considers multiple factors:
- Material balance
- Piece positions
- Pawn structure
- King safety
- Mobility

## Scoring System
Detailed explanation of how positions are scored...

# Implementation Details
Technical details about the implementation:
- Data structures used
- Algorithm optimizations
- Performance considerations

# Usage Guide
How to use the chess engine:
1. Setting up the board
2. Making moves
3. Getting engine evaluations
4. Using the interface
